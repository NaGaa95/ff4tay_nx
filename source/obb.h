 * main.obb is a Square Enix "ARC1" archive. Every blob (header, table of
 * contents and each file) is XOR'd with an LCG keystream seeded by
 * 98910408 + blobOffset, and the plaintext is [uint32 BE size][gzip stream].
 * The TOC holds <count> 12-byte little-endian entries
 * { nameOffset, fileOffset, fileLength } followed by a NUL-terminated name
 * region. The whole scheme was reverse-engineered from MainActivity and
 * validated against the real file (see obbtest*.py).
